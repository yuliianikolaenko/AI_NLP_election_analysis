Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets

The goal of the research: To explore the discourse and public opinion around the election across the USA states based on sentiment analysis and topic modelling.

Team: Yuliia Nikolaenko, Mihaela Grigore, Lara Wagner

Questions to answer:

1. In which states Biden is behind Trump (sentiment by state for the whole 3 weeks datasets)
2. In the states where we want to attract people to our side:
2.1 What topics are they interestd in ? (cluster of 5-ish topics, % of discussion per topic per state) -> this tells us: people in state x are mostly takling about this topic
2.2 Are they happy or dissatisfied with that topic ? (sentiment analysis + topic analysis per country) -> this tells us: people in state x are mostly talking about thic topic and they are not happy about it => we need to includ in our discourse how we plan to improve that area
